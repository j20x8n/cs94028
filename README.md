Tips 
Read through the entire test first before starting the   exam.
Do not leave blanks - attempt all problems, you   cannot get   marks   for blanks.
Read carefully and be sure you answer what is being   asked.
Give concise answers.   State any assumptions you make.
Marks 
Marks for each part of   the   question are shown   in   the   question   as [X].   The   total number   of   marks is 90.
1. Choose whether the following statements are true or false. If a statement is false, explain why? [20] 
T       F          The enthalpy and internal energy   of   an   ideal   gas   only   depend   on the temperature of   the   system.
T       F          With the same undercooling, the heterogeneous nucleation requires   smaller
critical nuclei size and lower energy barrier than the homogeneous nucleation.
T       F          Based on the first law of   thermodynamics, energy   is   always   conserved,   while entropy could be created.
T       F          At constant composition and entropy, the enthalpy   will   decrease   as pressure increases.
T       F          The reason to form. coherent embryo is   that minimizing   interfacial   energy   is   more important than minimizing strain energy.
T       F          In an adiabatic expansion of   an ideal   gas   the   temperature   always   goes   up.
2. One mole of a diatomic ideal gas is subjected to the following sequence of steps: 
(a)   Starting at 300K and   1 atm, the gas is   heated   reversibly   to   代 写MAT E 640 Advanced Materials Thermodynamics Midterm Examination 2020Matlab
代做程序编程语言600K   at   constant   volume.
(b) The gas is reversibly expanded at constant temperature until   its volume   is   again   doubled.
(c) The gas is then reversibly cooled to 300K   at   constant pressure.
(d) The gas finally expands freely into   a vacuum   to   double   its   volume.
Calculate the values of q and w and the changes in U, H, and S for each step. [20] 
3. A hypothetic system with two available energy levels ε0 and ε 1 is populated by N particles at constant temperature T. 
(a) Calculate the average energy per particle. [5] 
(b) Calculate the   entropy   of   the   system   with N particles. [5] 
4.    Show   [5] 
5. Below is the crystal structure   of   wurtzite ZnS   (yellow   is   Zn   and   grey   is   S).   What   is   the   total   configurational   entropy   in   each   of   following   question?   (Note: the   total   number   of sublattice sites for   Zn   is NA)
(a) A perfectly ordered wurtzite ZnS crystal (with no defects), as   shown below. [5] 
(b) A perfectly   ordered wurtzite ZnS   crystal, but with   one   vacancy   on   the   sublattice   of Zn atoms and one vacancy on the   sublattice   of S atoms. [5] 
(c) A perfectly   ordered wurtzite   ZnS   crystal, but   with   one   extra   S   atom   substitutes   the   sublattice of   Zn atoms. [5] 
(d)   A   perfectly   ordered   wurtzite   ZnS   crystal,   but   with   one   nearest   neighbor   Zn   and   S   atoms exchanged position. [5] 

6. Draw schematic G-P curves which would be consistent with the iron T-P diagram   shown as below at the temperatures 400, 600, and   1600°C. Neglect the   δ phase. [15]
